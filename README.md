AppList
=======

A simple Android installed apps viewer made for the Android course @FMI

The app has a single screen, containing a list with all the currently installed apps on your Android device.

When you tap an item from the list, the corresponding application automatically starts.

You can also search for apps by name - simply type in the search field.

Here are some screenshots:
